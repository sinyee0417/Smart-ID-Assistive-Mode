# Smart ID Assistive Mode

## One-line
Smart ID Assistive Mode — a universal accessibility layer that adapts Smart ID interfaces for seniors, persons with disabilities, low-literacy users, and rural communities.

## Problem
Many Malaysians face barriers using digital government services: small text, complex UI, motor difficulties, low literacy, and limited rural connectivity. These issues cause exclusion, long counter queues, and low trust in digital services.

## Solution
When a user taps their Smart ID at a kiosk or terminal, the system reads profile flags and automatically activates **Assistive Mode** — a simplified UI with:
- Large text and large buttons  
- Icon-based menus for low-literacy users  
- Multilingual voice instructions (Bahasa Melayu, 中文, English)  
- Gesture-friendly navigation for motor-impaired users  
- Offline-ready mode for rural kiosks
