# Smart ID Assistive Mode

## One-line
Smart ID Assistive Mode — a universal accessibility layer that adapts Smart ID interfaces for seniors, persons with disabilities, low-literacy users, and rural communities.

## Problem
Many Malaysians face barriers using digital government services: small text, complex UIs, motor difficulties, low literacy, and limited rural connectivity. This leads to exclusion and long counter queues.

## Solution
When a user taps their Smart ID, the system reads profile indicators and automatically loads an Assistive Mode UI with:
- Large text and buttons  
- Multilingual voice instructions (BM, Mandarin, Tamil)  
- Icon-based menus for low literacy users  
- Gesture navigation for motor-impaired users  
- Screen-reader friendly layout  
- Offline-ready mode for rural kiosks
